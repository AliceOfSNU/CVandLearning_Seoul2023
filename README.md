## Computer Vision and Visual Learning 2023

This repository contains starter code for completeing coding assignments.
Refer to below and the READMEs in each folder for details. (check for updates)

### Lab 1. Weakly Supervised Learning [(Link)](https://visual-learning.cs.cmu.edu/f22/hw1.html)

*OUT: 11월 01일 수요일*

*DUE: 11월 14일 화요일 23:59*

We will write and train object detectors with only image-level class labels and without the bounding box annotations. 

Please refer to Week 11 of [this](https://visual-learning.cs.cmu.edu/f22/schedule.html) course for reading materials.

### Lab 2.Visual QA with Cross-Attention [(Link)](https://github.com/visual-learning/vqa)

*OUT: 12월 30일 수요일*

*DUE: 01월 07일 일요일 23:59*

Using cross-attention, we train on a visual QA task combining textual features from BERT and visual features from resnet. Then, we train on larger, deeper models, which do not fit in a single GPU, and compare performance.
